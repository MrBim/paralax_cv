            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I am a passionate and driven programmer, with a strong belief in lifelong learning and have a desire to constantly improve my skills and knowledge. 

            Through working in multidisciplinary environments I have learned to communicate technical ideas in a way that is understandable to people who find tech speak confusing and pride myself on the ability to do so.</p> 
            
            <p>I have worked on my own, as part of a team and have also led teams in a variety of different environments and industries. </p>
           
            <p>I have many transferable skills, which I learned in other areas of my life, including problem solving, working to deadlines, and being a fast learner as well as having strong interpersonal skills.</p> 
            <p>I believe these skills will make me a valuable asset to your organisation.</p>

            <p>Due to having used a number of languages and programming paradigms, I am confident in my ability to become proficient with any new technologies rapidly when needed for any particular project.</p>

            <h2>Other relevant Information</h2>
            <p>For the last year, I have been working with a number of technologies for enjoyment and personal projects. This has made me realise how much I enjoy programming. Therefore, I am looking to turn this passion into a career.</p>

            <p>I am currently studying for a diploma in full stack web development (European qualification level 5). As part of this, I have been tutoring some of my fellow students as well as working on a collaboration project outside of the course requirements. </p>

            <p>Further to this I have experience of using visual programming environments such as puredata and max/msp, for signal processing as well as extensive use of Midi controllers and inter device communication for multimedia and audio creation, installations and performance. </p>


            <p>Over the lat year I have also started playing with a number or micro controllers and SBC’s including Arduino (due, mega2560 and micro) BBC Micro:Bit, Raspberry Pi and Axoloti. Recently I have started to explore the leap motion controller.</p>



            <h2>Experience</h2>

            <p>Thanks to my past experience I have a keen appreciation of task prioritization, alongside an understanding of realistic deadlines. I am also confident in my ability to maintain high quality work under pressure whilst maintaining a professional attitude.</p>

            <p>I have been creating a portfolio of projects I have worked on, or am working on in my free time.
